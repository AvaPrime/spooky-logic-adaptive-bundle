# Spooky Logic v0.5 â€” Autonomous Tenants & Federated Experiments

This release adds **per-tenant meta-conductors** and a **federated experiment aggregator**.
- Each tenant gets a self-tuning mini-orchestrator that can trial variants and request promotions, guarded by OPA.
- A federation layer aggregates experiment signals across clusters, detects drift, and produces global summaries.

## Wire-up
- Include `api/routers/federation.py` and mount it in `api/main.py`.
- Run `cli/spookyfed.py` to submit cross-cluster samples or query summaries/drift.
- Use `TenantMetaConductor` in your tenant registry to choose playbooks per request and report outcomes.
- Load `policies/tenant_autonomy.rego` into OPA; enforce budgets in promotion calls.
- Optionally broadcast samples via your event bus (NATS/Kafka); adapter not included in this pack.
