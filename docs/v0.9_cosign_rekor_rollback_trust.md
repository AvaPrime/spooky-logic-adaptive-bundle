# Spooky Logic v0.9 — Cosign/Rekor, Auto-Rollback, Trust Tiers

**Cosign/Rekor**
- `cosign_adapter.py` verifies blobs/attestations using the cosign CLI.
- `rekor_adapter.py` checks transparency log inclusion by SHA.
- Use after bundle verification (v0.7) and before adoption.

**Auto-Rollback w/ Blast-Radius**
- `rollback/controller.py` stages traffic removal (25/50/75/100%) on a timer.
- Pair with OPA to enforce maximum blast radius per tenant.

**Supply-chain Scorecard → Trust-aware Routing**
- `security/scorecard.py` computes a 0–1 score from SBOM/provenance/cosign/rekor/vuln severity.
- `routing/trust_router.py` nudges candidate weights based on trust tier A–D.

**APIs**
- `/supplychain/score` to compute score/tier.
- `/rollback/start|status|tick` to drive staged rollback.
