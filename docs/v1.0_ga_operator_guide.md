# Spooky Logic v1.0 GA — Operator Guide (Golden Path)

## SLOs (suggested)
- p50 latency < 1.5s; p95 < 4s
- Task success rate >= 98% (validated)
- Error budget: 1% / 30 days

## Alerts
- p95 latency > 4s for 5m
- debate win rate drops > 15% day-over-day
- killswitch active > 0 for more than 10m

## Runbooks
- **Promotion stuck**: check `/experiments/summary`, OPA logs (promotion policy), then `/federation/summary`.
- **Regression spike**: trigger `/security/killswitch/trigger`, start `/rollback/start`, file an incident in governance board.
- **Capability adoption**: `/capabilities/verify` → `/security/scan` → quarantine + canary → policy auto-adopt.

## Backups & DR
- `scripts/backup.sh` nightly; keep 7 rotations.
- `scripts/restore.sh` to recover Postgres.

## Multi-Cluster Governance
- Periodically POST `/governance/sync/merge` with peer snapshots; store state in a shared bucket for cold-starts.
